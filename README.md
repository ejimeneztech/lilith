# Lilith

**Lilith** is a 2D top-down horror game built in **Unity (C#)**.  
The project focuses on **gameplay systems, clean architecture, and interaction design**, rather than visuals alone.

This is an active work-in-progress used to demonstrate gameplay programming, system design, and Unity workflows.
